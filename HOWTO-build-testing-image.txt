HOW-TO Build a Debian Testing (Jessie) Image
============================================

1. Boot from a Debian Wheezy Image ((Debian Wheezy 7.7 64-bits 20141022 - Partner Image)

2. Login to the host.

   a. Edit /etc/apt/sources.list replacing it with:

   | deb http://http.debian.net/debian testing main
   | deb http://http.debian.net/debian testing-updates main
   | deb http://security.debian.org testing/updates main
   |
   | deb-src http://http.debian.net/debian testing main
   | deb-src http://http.debian.net/debian testing-updates main
   | deb-src http://security.debian.org testing/updates main

   b. Upgrade to Testing (Jessie) with the following sequence of
      commands run as root:

   # apt-get update                           ## Update cache
   # apt-get -y --download-only dist-upgrade  ## pre-download
   # apt-get -y -f dist-upgrade               ## Force Upgrade
   #
   # ## The dist-upgrade may fail, repeat as needed
   #
   # apt-get -y -f dist-upgrade               ## repeat until
   #                                          ## successful 
   # apt-get -y autoremove                    ## clean-up

   c. Upgrade complete.  Shutdown the host for imaging
   
   # shutdown -h now

3. "Create Snapshot" of the insance from the Horizon console.
   - alternate:  'nova image-create'  -- see nova command help.

Done.
